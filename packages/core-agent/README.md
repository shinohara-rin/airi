# Core Agent

`@proj-airi/core-agent` owns scheduling, context composition, tool rounds, and generation events. Stage applications provide persistence and UI through its ports. Provider registration and configuration belong to `provider-inference`. Authentication and Flux billing belong to the gateway.

## Event loop

`AgentLoop` runs one agent with one conversation. Producers push events with `push`. Each event has a trigger mode, and the producer chooses it.

| Mode | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `preempt` | Delivers now. It cancels a model call that has produced no output. |
| `flush` | Delivers now with the queued events. |
| `debounce` | Joins a batch. The batch delivers after a quiet gap, an age limit, or a size limit. |
| `piggyback` | Waits in the queue and rides with the next batch. It never wakes the agent. |

Each delivered batch runs one turn. A preempted turn returns its events to the queue. An interrupted turn discards them. An optional heartbeat pushes a quiet notice and doubles its interval for each quiet beat, up to eight times. An optional spend guard turns `debounce` events into `piggyback` events while a token budget is used up. Tool receipts are cut to `maxReceiptChars` and say how much they left out.

The loop keeps its own history unless the application passes `buildConversation`. The chat orchestrator does this, so the stored chat session stays the source of the conversation. It also exposes `pushEvent` for plugin events and the stage.

```ts
const loop = new AgentLoop({
  llm,
  resolveRequest: () => ({ model, chatProvider, providerId, systemPrompt }),
  heartbeatMs: () => 30_000,
})
loop.start()
loop.push({ type: 'game.job_finished', source: 'game', text: 'the mining job finished' }, { trigger: 'flush' })
```

See `docs/ai/adr/2026-09-30-event-driven-agent-core.md` for the decision.

## Conversation and protocol projection

`Conversation` contains ordered `Turn` values. `UserTurn` owns user content. `SystemTurn` owns instructions or application context. Its authority distinguishes system instructions, developer instructions, and context data. Application context does not gain instruction authority merely because the application supplied it.

`AssistantTurn` owns an ordered `rounds` array. One round represents one model invocation and all tool executions it requested, including parallel calls. Its content references tool invocations; each invocation owns its call and result once. The provider call id correlates results within that round. Tool reruns use the AIRI invocation id to distinguish repeated provider call ids. A run id refers to a real scheduler execution, not the number of rounds. Imported history has no model-call metadata when that information is unavailable.

`ProviderContinuation` stores each protocol's own SDK message type: Chat `Message[]` or Responses `ItemParam[]`.

`streamFrom` selects the configured provider capability before request projection. The Chat adapter renders Chat Completions messages. The Responses adapter renders native Items directly from the same context. Chat array compatibility cannot change Responses input. Both projections leave the context snapshot unchanged.

When a caller supplies `resolveStep`, `streamFrom` reads current settings before each model request. It resolves the first request before projecting the conversation. A continuation scope change starts a new SDK stream. Completed rounds and usage remain in one assistant turn. The callback returns the current tools and header overrides for each request.

```ts
await streamFrom({
  model: 'selected-model',
  chatProvider: selectedProvider,
  conversation: {
    turns: [{
      id: 'input-1',
      type: 'user',
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello' }],
    }],
  },
})
```

The existing session store uses Chat-shaped UI records. The orchestrator decodes those records at the storage boundary, then composes runtime context as structured segments. Chat sends, vision inputs, and Spark notifications use the same generation contract. Hooks and the plugin bridge receive a separate display projection. That projection is text-only and excludes native continuation data and media payloads. Images, audio, and files become labels, including tool results.

## Turn history

After all SDK steps settle, `onGeneratedTurn` receives the new `AssistantTurn`. Each round records model usage, its finish reason, tool invocations, and native continuation data. SDK input snapshots define round boundaries; message roles do not define runtime rounds.

The generated turn contains settled rounds and is stored under the existing `generationTranscript` history key. Live deltas still use the existing stream event contract. An interrupted execution does not store a generated turn. If it produced visible output, local Chat history preserves that output with `interrupted: true` so the user can read and retry it.

The adapter preserves SDK continuation data without parsing nested provider fields through local schemas. It checks the outer array before replay. Its scope contains provider identity, endpoint, model, and conversation. Credentials and request headers do not change this scope. A protocol or scope change projects round content. Unknown native content records a projection issue without removing the original payload or other readable items. Cross-protocol projection reports that issue instead of silently omitting content. A local tool-result edit invalidates native data for that round and later rounds that used the old result. Cancelled or failed generations do not commit a generated turn. `AssistantTurn.status` is therefore `completed`. Tool executions within that turn can still report failure.

Local history preserves complete turns and visible output from interrupted turns. Interrupted records stay on the device because the cloud wire format cannot preserve their incomplete state. Cloud chat sync currently transfers completed text and does not restore native continuation on another device.

## Responses API

A provider resolves a discriminated `GenerationRequest` before context projection. The adapter owns its wire format and SDK event conversion. The adapter uses `@xsai-ext/responses` with `store: false`. It replays complete Items and executes local function tools for at most ten steps.

The current Responses adapter supports text, images, file data or URLs, refusals, and function calls. It rejects audio input and provider file IDs. It supports provider-executed web search alongside local function tools. Search records remain in native continuation. Citation events and portable text retain source URLs and offsets. Incomplete responses and EOF before a terminal event fail the generation. Session cancellation aborts the active provider request.

Realtime transport is not implemented. A future session adapter can project the same context, but must define continuous input, interruption, and session ownership separately.

```

## Type boundaries

Turn types constrain their content. User and system turns cannot contain execution rounds. Only assistant rounds own tool invocations.
Files have exactly one source. SDK output and restored continuation enter through protocol boundaries.
The public stream event union has no `any` branch. Protocol adapters translate SDK events into this contract.
The scheduler commits a generated turn only after transport, local tools, and event consumers complete.
Source links remain separate from speech text and survive local history persistence.
