/**
 * Fix for iOS Silent Mode audio playback issues.
 *
 * iOS Safari/Webkit often mutes Web Audio API (AudioContext) when the physical
 * silent switch is on, even if we resume the context.
 *
 * The workaround is to play a short silent audio file using the HTML5 <audio> element
 * triggered by a user interaction. This forces the OS to switch the audio session
 * category to "Playback" (or equivalent) which allows sound even in silent mode.
